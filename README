# Dotfiles and `myde` (My Dev Environment)
This repo contains two things:
1. My dotfiles and a script to link them on a new machine
2. A Dockerfile that sets up my preferred development environment

Both are provided in the same repo, but you only need to pick one of the above

TODO: 
- Set the image to pull my dotfiles repo and link the files instead of copying. . . that will let me more quickly update them.
- Set up a docker image to build my resume with the proper latex packages. Set up automated build where it recreates any time I push a change!
